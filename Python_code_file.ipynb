This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. However, traditional methods of handling product data may be cumbersome and prone to errors. They often involve manual entry and maintenance processes, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. By harnessing the capabilities of Python programming, we can develop a solution that automates tasks such as adding, reading, updating, and deleting product information. This streamlined approach not only enhances data accuracy and reliability but also improves operational efficiency.\n","\n","The kind of operations that we are going to focus on have an acronym: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"yAXrIqlKjthg"},"source":["**CRUD** operations represent the four basic functions that are essential to interact with a database or a data storage system. The acronym CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations form the foundation of most applications that store and manipulate data. Understanding CRUD is crucial for developers working on web, software, and database applications. Here's a brief overview of each operation:\n","\n","- **Create**: This operation is used to add new records to a database. It involves inserting data into a database table or a data structure. For example, adding a new user to a user database is a Create operation.\n","\n","- **Read**: This operation is used to retrieve or read data from a database. It involves querying the database to fetch information based on certain criteria. For example, fetching all the information about a product is a Read operation.\n","\n","- **Update**: This operation is used to modify existing data in a database. It involves updating one or more fields of a database record. For example, changing a user's email address in a user database is an Update operation.\n","\n","- **Delete**: This operation is used to remove records from a database. It involves deleting one or more records from a database table. For example, removing a user from a user database is a Delete operation.\n","\n","These operations are vital for managing data effectively in any application. They allow applications to perform basic data management tasks, ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and accessible.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_bIkNbC2z8oL"},"source":["# Problem Statement\n","Your task is to develop a product information management system for an e-commerce platform that facilitates the creation, retrieval, updation, and deletion of product details, sales data, and description.\n","\n","To solve this, you will first load the whole dataset into the computer's memory and provide the users an option to choose between the CRUD operations. When the user has made a choice, you will perform the chosen operation by allowing the user to input the required information. When the user is done with their task and chooses to exit the program, you will save the new files in the same folder by overwriting the files.\n","\n","# Data Description\n","The dataset for this project has been provided in the *filehandler_data.zip* file. It contains data about products for which the unique ID provided is the stock keeping unit or SKU for short. The ZIP file contains a structured collection of sales data and product information organized into a main folder with three key components:\n","\n","- **Sales Data** (*sales_data.csv*): A CSV file that includes sales data for various products over a 14-day period. Each row corresponds to a different product, identified by a *Product_SKU*. The columns *Day1* through *Day14* represent the sales figures for each consecutive day.\n","\n","- **Product Descriptions** (*product_descriptions* folder): This folder contains text files, each corresponding to a specific product identified by the SKU in the filename (e.g., *description_AISJDKFJW93NJ.txt*). These files provide descriptive information about the products.\n","\n","- **Product Details** (*product_details* folder): This folder includes JSON files, again with filenames corresponding to product SKUs (e.g., *details_AISJDKFJW93NJ.json*). These files contain detailed attributes of the products, such as specifications, category, pricing, etc.\n","\n","This dataset is suitable for analyzing daily sales performance of products, supplemented with detailed product information and descriptions to allow for a comprehensive analysis of sales trends in relation to product attributes and descriptions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"TCi_8EQ_SKh2"},"source":["# Outline\n","The overall objective of this project is to create a system for managing product information in an e-commerce platform.
